This repository serves as a template for applications powered by OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT). It's designed to be a starting point for developers looking to integrate OpenAI's powerful natural language processing capabilities into their applications.

## Overview

The `OpenAI-App-Temp` provides a foundational structure for building applications that leverage OpenAI's models for tasks such as text generation, completion, translation, summarization, and more.

## Features

- **Pre-configured Integration**: Easily connect to OpenAI's API with minimal setup.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to grow with your project, whether it's a small prototype or a large-scale application.
- **Customizable**: Tailor the template to fit your specific use case and requirements.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository: 

Clone this repository to your local machine to get started.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ahmedtawfeeq1/OpenAI-App-Temp.git
   ```


### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies.

    
    cd OpenAI-App-Temp
    npm install
    

### 3. Configure OpenAI Credentials

Add your OpenAI API key to the appropriate configuration file. 

__HINT:__ __Rename `.env.example` to `.env` then add your OPENAI_API_KEY & PORT to it instead of dummies. And you are ready to go!__


### 4. Run the Application

Start the development server or build the production version as needed.

    cd server // make sure to run the server from the server directory, obvious :XD
    npm start


### 5. Run the Client App

Open the sample basic client to interact with the model and ask from the UI.

    cd client // make sure to run your client UI from the client directory, obviou again :XD
    npm run dev
    
### 6. Ready to test

In case you did all right without any issues, you should be able to talk to OpenAI right now!
