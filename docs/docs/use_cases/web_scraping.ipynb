In terms of planning, the agent breaks down large tasks into smaller subgoals and can reflect and refine its actions based on past experiences. Memory is divided into short-term memory, which is used for in-context learning, and long-term memory, which allows the agent to retain and recall information over extended periods. Tool use involves the agent calling external APIs for additional information.
